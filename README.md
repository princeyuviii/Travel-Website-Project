# Frontent

This is a personal project to get better at React. I used [Scrimba's React tutorial](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact/), which was extremely helpful at understanding essential React concepts.

Concepts to take away from:
- Basic HTML and CSS concepts
- Props and JSX
- .Mapping()

# Building the Frontend

You need to install npm, and I recommend having a Node Package Manager. Here is an [repo]([https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to get NVM.
Below are the commands for MacOS
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash
```
To verify the installation, use the following command
```
command -v nvm
```

You can now install npm using the following command
```
nvm install node
```

The website utilised [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) which helped to speed up bundling our frontend and building our website fast. To build the website locally, use the command
```
npm run dev
```
Which will host the website on a local port
