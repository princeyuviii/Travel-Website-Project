Travel Website - Frontend

This is a personal project as part of the Edunet internship to enhance my skills in building full-stack applications using the MERN stack. The frontend is built using React and Vite to ensure fast and efficient development.

Concepts Covered
	•	Fundamental HTML and CSS principles
	•	React basics: Props, JSX, and state management
	•	Advanced concepts like .map() for rendering dynamic lists

Tech Stack
	•	Frontend: React, Vite
	•	Backend: Node.js, Express.js
	•	Database: MongoDB

Setting Up the Frontend Locally

Before running the project, ensure you have npm installed. You can use Node Version Manager (NVM) for easy Node.js and npm installation.

Installing NVM

Below are the commands for MacOS to install NVM:
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.5/install.sh | bash
```
Verify the installation:
```
command -v nvm
```

Once NVM is installed, use the following command to install Node.js:
```
nvm install node
```

Running the Frontend

1.	Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/princeyuviii/Travel-Website-Project.git
```
2.	Navigate to the frontend directory:
```
cd frontend  
```
3.	Install dependencies:
```
npm install  
```

4.	Start the development server:
```
npm run dev
```

This will host the website on a local port (usually http://localhost:5173).

Tools and Libraries
	•	Vite: Used for fast bundling and optimized development.
	•	React: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
	•	NVM: For managing Node.js and npm versions.
